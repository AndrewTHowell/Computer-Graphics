To run the program, simply open the VanMildertCollege.html file in your Browser.

The screen holds instructions on how to interact with the scene, whether it be the 'player's' movement, setting the time and setting the Low Quality option On and Off.

CHARACTER MOVEMENT:
W: Move forward in the scene
A: Move left in the scene
S: Move backward in the scene
D: Move right in the scene

CAMERA MOVEMENT:
Up Arrow: Rotate view upward
Left Arrow: : Rotate view to the left
Down Arrow: : Rotate view downward
Right Arrow: : Rotate view to the right
    OR
Click the canvas (scene window) to access mouse controls, allowing you to look around with your mouse movement.
To stop using mouse controls, press ESC to regain your cursor.

CHANGING TIME OF DAY:
Slide the slider to change the time of day, and therefore the lighting conditions the scene has.

LOW QUALITY MODE:
The program has many complex objects, meaning it runs a little slowly. If you wish to observe a smoother, better viewing experience, tick the checkbox at the end of the LQ line. This will reduce the number of objects needed to render, speeding up the program whilst still allowing you to see at least one of every moving model.
